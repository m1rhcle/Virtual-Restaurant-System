# Virtual-Restaurant-System
 I created a virtual restaurant GUI system where the user selects and adds an order, which is sent to the waiter, who validates the order and sends the order to the chef, who prepares the order for a certain amount of time then returns the total order and time taken to prepare back to the customer.
